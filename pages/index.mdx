# Infinitism

What is infinitism?

First, infinitism is an ideology of the unbounded potential of humanity. It insists that there are no limits to the human condition, other than that which is forbidden by physics.

Second, infinitism is an optimistic ideology. By this we do not mean that it professes blind faith in a better future but rather that it espouses a recognition that a better future is within our power. Infinitism is a way of looking at the world that recognizes that human potential is unbounded and aspires to achieve it.

Third, infinitism is an ideology of rationality as opposed to dogmatism. Its principles, such as the aforementioned, are not presented to be dogmatically accepted. Rather, they are presented to be critically inspected and are justified via epistemology and reason.

Fourth, infinitism is a dynamic ideology rather than a static one. That is, every principle is meant to be questioned rather than blindly followed. Every principle found to be erroneous is meant to be changed rather than set in stone.

Fifth, infinitism adopts an epistemology of fallibilism. It is neither relativist or skeptical nor infallibilist because it asserts there is a truth and we can approach it, but never reach it. It is not empiricist or rationalist because it rejects that knowledge comes from observation alone or reason alone. Rather, it asserts that knowledge comes from a process of observation, creatively-generated explanation, and falsification.

Infinitism is inspired by some of the great philosophers of our time. The epistemology is built on the works of Charles Sanders Peirce (fallibilism), Karl Popper (falsifiability, critical rationalism), and ultimately, David Deustch (hard-to-vary explanations).
