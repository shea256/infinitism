# Infinitism

What is infinitism?

First, infinitism is an ideology of the unbounded potential of humanity. As an optimistic ideology, it insists that there are no limits to the human condition, other than that which is forbidden by physics. This doesn't mean that a better future is guaranteed, but rather that one is within our reach.

Second, infinitism is an ideology of rationality rather than dogmatism. Infinitism's principles, such as the aforementioned, are not presented to be dogmatically accepted. Rather, they are presented to be critically inspected and are justified via epistemology and reason.

Third, infinitism is a dynamic ideology rather than a static one. That is, every principle is meant to be questioned rather than blindly followed. Every principle found to be erroneous is meant to be changed rather than set in stone.

Fourth, infinitism is built on the epistemological principle of fallibilism, rather than relativism/skepticism on the one side or infallibilism on the other. That is, infinitism asserts there is a truth and we can approach it but simultaneously acknowledges that this truth can never be reached or established with certainty. The process of understanding more about our world is an infinite journey.

Fifth, infinitism is built on an epistemological philosophy of critical rationalism. It asserts that knowledge is not created through observation and logical conclusion. Rather, we identify puzzles about the world around us, use our creativity to generate explanations, and test them through experience to see if they hold up in the physical world.

Infinitism is inspired by some of the great philosophers of our time. The epistemology is built on the works of Charles Sanders Peirce (fallibilism), Karl Popper (falsifiability, critical rationalism), Thomas Kuhn (postpositivism, paradigm shifts), and ultimately and most importantly, David Deustch (hard-to-vary explanations, universality).
