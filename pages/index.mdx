# Infinitism

What is infinitism?

First, infinitism is an ideology of the unbounded potential of humanity. It insists that there are no limits to the human condition, other than that which is forbidden by physics.

Second, infinitism is an optimistic ideology. By this we do not mean that it teaches blind faith in a better future but rather a recognition that a better future is within our power. Infinitism is a way of looking at the world that recognizes the reality of unbounded potential and at the same time aspires to achieve it.

Third, infinitism is a dynamic ideology rather than a static one, a rational one rather than a dogmatic one. That is, every tenet is meant to be questioned rather than blindly followed. Every tenet found to be erroneous is meant to be changed rather than set in stone.

Infinitism is inspired by some of the great philosophers of our time, in particular David Deustch and James Carse.
