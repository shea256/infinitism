# Infinitism

Welcome to Infinitism - a rational, dynamic ideology (a memeplex) that is inspired by some of the great philosophers of our time, in particular David Deutsch and James Carse.

Indeed, because infinitism is a rational-dynamic ideology, and all rational-dynamic ideologies converge, the core of infinitism is an expression of *the rational meme* (a singleton) that all rational-dynamic ideologies aim to manifest.

The rest of infinitism is a pragmatic, cultural wrapper around the rational core, and it is designed for the highest possible fitness of the memeplex within human populations.

There are four main components of infinitism, and they are split up into four books: [epistemology](/epistemology), [ethics](/ethics), [metaphysics](/metaphysics), and [ritual](/ritual).
