# Ethics

Infinitism asserts that "all evils are due to insufficient knowledge."

This is based on the principle of moral fallibilism, which states that there is an objective moral standard and it can be approached but never reached or truly known.

If this is true, then morality means (1) following the objective moral standard (2) getting us closer to identifying what the objective moral standard is.

Following the objective moral standard is dependent on our ability to know it, which is why the ethics of Infinitism holds knowledge above all else.

Infinitism does not identify what the objective moral standard is. This is for humanity to progressively discover from now until the end of time.
