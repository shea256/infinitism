### Who writes the content for infinitism?

Hi, my name is Ryan Shea and I am the author behind infinitism dot com. I am not a philosopher. I merely repackage the philosophies of some of the greatest philosophers of our time.

### Who inspired this exploration into infinitism?

This exploration first started many years ago with my exposure to Popper, Kuhn, Deutsch and Peirce, and it grew from there.

I first read Karl Popper in a class on epistemology at Princeton.

Later, I was introduced to Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Melanie Shapiro and introduced to David Deutsch's "The Beginning of Infinity" by Albert Wenger.

I was eventually inspired to dive deeper into "The Beginning of Infinity" by Naval Ravikant's collaboration with Brett Hall, and this coincided with my exploration into epistemology in a community called Praxis, where I was introduced to Charles Sanders Peirce by Suehiko Ono.

Through continued discussions in the Praxis community, I realized that my perspective of the world closely followed that of Deutsch and his predecessors, plus had some additional elements that were compatible with and stemmed from the core epistemology.

This led me to write my own description of what I thought was an evolving ideology, largely defined by Peirce, Popper, Kuhn, and Deutsch - infinitism.
